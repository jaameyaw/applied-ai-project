POINT_WEIGHTING_PROMPT = """
Use the data in #file:data/songs.csv as context for designing a transparent song recommendation scoring system.

I am building a simple classroom music recommender. Please suggest a balanced point-weighting strategy for these song features:
- genre
- mood
- energy
- acousticness
- tempo_bpm
- valence
- danceability

The goal is to create a score that feels intuitive, not extreme. I want clear tradeoffs between exact category matches and close numeric matches.

Please answer these questions:
1. How many points should a Genre match be worth?
2. How many points should a Mood match be worth?
3. Should Genre count more than Mood, or should they be equal? Explain why.
4. How should near-matches in Energy be scored compared to exact matches in Genre or Mood?
5. Should Acousticness, Tempo, Valence, and Danceability have smaller bonus weights? If so, suggest reasonable point values.
6. Propose one complete sample formula with point values and a short explanation of why it is balanced for this dataset.

Please keep the recommendation system simple and interpretable, and base your suggestions on the kinds of songs and attributes that appear in the CSV.
